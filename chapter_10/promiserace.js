// The Promise.race() static method accepts a list of promises as an iterable object and returns a new promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as there is one promise that fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.
// Because the promise1 is resolved earlier than the promise2, the promise1 wins the race
