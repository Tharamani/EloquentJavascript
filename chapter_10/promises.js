// a promise is an object that encapsulates the result of an asynchronous operation.
// A promise object has a state that can be one of the following:

// Pending => state of a promise is pending, indicating asynchronous operation is in progress
// Fulfilled with a value => state of a promise is Fulfilled, indicates that the asynchronous operation was completed successfully:
// Rejected for a reason => state of a promise is Rejected, indicates that the asynchronous operation failed.
