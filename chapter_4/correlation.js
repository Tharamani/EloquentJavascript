// Correlation is a measure of dependence between statistical variables
// Correlation between variables is usually expressed as a value that ranges from -1 to 1. Zero correlation = the variables are not related.
// A correlation of one indicates that the two are perfectly related—if you know one, you also know the other. Negative one also means that the variables are perfectly related but that they are opposites—when one is true, the other is false.

// ompute the measure of correlation between two Boolean variables, we can use the phi coefficient (ϕ). This is a formula whose input is a frequency table containing the number of times the different combinations of the variables were observed. The output of the formula is a number between -1 and 1 that describes the correlation.
