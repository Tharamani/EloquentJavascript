//Note : Using the remainder (%) operator is an easy way to test whether a number is divisible by another number.If it is, the remainder of their division is zero

// The for construct in the example does not have a part that checks for the end of the loop. This means that the loop will never stop unless the break statement inside is executed.

// continue keyword
// When continue is encountered in a loop body, control jumps out of the body and continues with the loopâ€™s next iteration.
