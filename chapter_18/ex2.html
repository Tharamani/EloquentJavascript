        <h1>Form fields - Focus</h1>
        <h3><p>Form fields can get keyboard focus.
            When clicked or activated in some other way, they become the currently active element </p>
        
           <p> Can type into a text field only when it is focused.
            Other fields respond differently to keyboard events.
            example, a 'select' menu tries to move to the option that contains the text the user typed and responds to the arrow keys by moving its selection up and down.
        </p>
    <p>
                We can control focus from JavaScript with the focus and blur methods. The first moves focus to the DOM element it is called on, and the second removes focus.
            </p>

        <h4>The value in document.activeElement corresponds to the currently focused element.

          HTML also provides the autofocus attribute, which produces the same effect while letting the browser know what we are trying to achieve
        </h4>
